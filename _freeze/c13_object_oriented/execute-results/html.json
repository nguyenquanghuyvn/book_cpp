An named object is a variable.\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) provides us with the ability to create objects that tie together both **properties**(e.g. color, weight, size, shape, etc...) and **behaviors** (e.g. being opened, make something else hot, etc...).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyou.driveTo(work);\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is not only read more clearly, it also make it clearer who is the subject and what behavior. This makes the program to be written in a more *modular fashion*.\n\nObjects in OOP include normal definition and combines both properties and behaviors.\n\n ## Classes and class members\n \n \n\n\n\n\n",
