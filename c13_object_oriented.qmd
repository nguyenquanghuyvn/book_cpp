title: "Basic Object-oriented Programming"
---

In C++, object is a piece of memory to store values. An named object is a variable.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) provides us with the ability to create objects that tie together both **properties**(e.g. color, weight, size, shape, etc...) and **behaviors** (e.g. being opened, make something else hot, etc...).

```{r example_object}

you.driveTo(work);

```

This is not only read more clearly, it also make it clearer who is the subject and what behavior. This makes the program to be written in a more *modular fashion*.

Objects in OOP include normal definition and combines both properties and behaviors.
